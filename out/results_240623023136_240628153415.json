The swelling is usually due to an infection of the soft tissue of the gums, but it can also be due to a periosteal abscess. A periosteal abscess is an infection of the bone around the tooth. This usually happens due to a failure to treat the root canal properly. The root canal treatment is usually done to remove the infected pulp from the tooth.
